## Project
### Managing Maintenance Workflow
#### Synopsis
Developed for Lockheed Martin, this responsive web application is used to manage and showcase the workflow of maintenance requests for products, typically IT licenses. Owners of maintenance requests will be able to import requests from existing CSV Files or manually input the data. Relevant users will be notified of upcoming maintenance requests via email. The notification cadence is configurable to the organizationâ€™s needs, but a default frequency is provided to each request. These users may be able to track and approve budgets. Reports can be generated on budgets, actual amount paid, and outstanding costs that owners and/or owning managers are responsible for. These reports potentially aid in cost analysis and budgeting for the department. The project is created leveraging AWS services into a deployment pipeline that aims to automate maintenance tracking empowering a more efficient process.
